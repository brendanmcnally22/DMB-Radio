# DMB-Radio
DMB-Radio is the prototype we made for the first DevCon rapid prototype. We decided that the game mechanic we would experiment with and see what we could do with was, creating a microphone that would record your voice and allow you to play it back.

## Objective Statement
Our objective statement was:
> _The goal with DMB0radio is to create an immersive gameplay experience the enhances that feel of puzzles and makes the game more memorable by utilizing the players voice to solve puzzles and make their way through the game._

## Design Rationale
Our groups rationale behind DMB-radio was creating a game mechganic that felt fun and immersive and allowed the player free creative freedom. We wanted our mechanic to be utilized in many different types of games from, stealth game, to puzzle games. Once we had our core game mechanic for our rapid prototype we came up with some ideas that our microphone concept could be used in.
### Ideas
1. Our first and primary idea was utilizing the recordings for a puzzle game, where you could record your voice and then use that to unlock things like treasure chests and doors.
2. Our puzzle idea was fairly broad so we decided to come up with a more specific idea. Darren suggested using the recording prototype for a military type stealth game where you could record you voice then play it to lure enemies places.
3. Our final concept for what we could use our prototype for was a horror game where everytime you speak a monster would also be able to hear you.
